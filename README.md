## 📌 Project Title / Headline  
**MediTrack Analytics: Hospital Patient Insights Dashboard**  
A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to monitor patient records, medical charges, treatment history, and doctor performance in hospitals.  

---

## 🎯 Short Description / Purpose  
The **Hospital Patient Dashboard** is a visually engaging and analytical Power BI report designed to help hospital staff, doctors, and administrators track patient details, appointments, treatments, and billing in real time.  

It highlights patient charges, medicine sales, appointment schedules, and overall hospital insights for better decision-making and patient care.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:  

- **MySQL** → Database used for storing patient records, billing, and medicine sales.  
- **SQL Queries** → Written for data extraction, transformations, and joining multiple hospital-related tables.  
- **Power BI Desktop** → Main data visualization platform for creating reports.  
- **Power Query** → Data transformation & cleaning for preparing patient and hospital datasets.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** → Used for calculated measures, KPIs, and conditional logic.  
- **Data Modeling** → Relationships established among patient details, billing, and medicine sales tables to enable cross-analysis.  

---

## 📊 Data Source  
Data used in the dashboard includes:  

- **Patient Details** → Personal info, doctor assigned, diagnosis, admission/discharge dates.  
- **Appointments** → Upcoming and past schedules with doctors.  
- **Billing Data** → Patient charges by type (surgery, room, medicine, test, etc.).  
- **Medicine Sales** → Quantity and type of medicines prescribed/sold.  

> 💾 All the above data was stored in **MySQL tables** and extracted into Power BI using custom SQL queries.
